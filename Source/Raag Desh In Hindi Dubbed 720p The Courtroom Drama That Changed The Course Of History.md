Raag Desh has received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences who have appreciated its patriotic message, its authentic portrayal of the historical period, its gripping narrative and its powerful performances. The film has been praised for shedding light on a lesser-known chapter of India's freedom struggle and for highlighting the sacrifices and contributions of the INA soldiers.
 
Some of the critics have also pointed out the flaws in the film, such as its stagey treatment, its excessive use of facts and dates, its lack of emotional depth and its uneven pace. The film has also been compared to other courtroom dramas and war films and has been found wanting in some aspects. Some critics have also felt that the film could have explored more of the ideological differences between Bose and Gandhi and their impact on the INA.
 
However, despite its shortcomings, Raag Desh is a commendable effort by Tigmanshu Dhulia and his team to bring to life a forgotten story of courage and patriotism. The film is a tribute to the INA heroes who fought for India's independence with their blood and sweat. The film also raises some pertinent questions about the nature of nationalism, loyalty and justice in times of war and peace.
 
Raag Desh is a film that deserves to be watched by every Indian who values freedom and democracy. It is a film that reminds us of our glorious past and inspires us to shape our future. It is a film that celebrates the spirit of Raag Desh: the love for one's country.
