In this article, we will give you a brief overview of the three modules of SecuriDesign and how they can help you create stunning security designs.
 
## Contour Generator
 
The Contour Generator is similar to the Contour effect in CorelDRAW, but with more flexibility and control. You can use it to create contour lines with variable offset from a control object. The offset is modulated by harmonic functions that you can edit using the Function Editor. You can also adjust the number of contours, the spacing, the color, and the style of the contour lines. The Contour Generator can be used to create base curves for rosettes, borders, frames, and other design elements.
 
## Pattern Generator
 
The Pattern Generator is used to produce guilloche fills between two selected curves in your CorelDRAW document. You need to have two curve shapes that are used as envelopes for the pattern. The resulting fill follows the path of both envelopes. You can use either the contour curves created by the Contour Generator or you can draw any curves using CorelDRAW's drawing tools. The Pattern Generator allows you to generate complex designs in one step. You can choose from various predefined patterns or create your own using the Function Editor. You can also change the color, width, and style of the pattern lines.
 
## Function Editor
 
The Function Editor is used to create mathematical functions that are used by both the Contour and Pattern Generators when creating contours and patterns. You can specify a function description as a set of Fourier coefficients or you can draw a function in your CorelDRAW document and have the Function Editor to digitize the function and produce the coefficients automatically to best fit the representation you drew. The Function Editor allows you to fine-tune the shape and appearance of your security designs.
 
## Conclusion
 
SecuriDesign for CorelDRAW X7 is a powerful tool for security printing that can help you create various designs with ease and efficiency. It is compatible with CorelDRAW X7 and Corel DESIGNER 12 and 10. It is not a free software, but it is worth buying a license from the official website of SecuriDesign. You will get lifetime updates and support, as well as avoid malware infection, legal trouble, and poor performance that may come with cracked software. SecuriDesign is a must-have for anyone who wants to create professional and secure designs with CorelDRAW.
